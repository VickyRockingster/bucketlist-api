## Planning, process, and problem-solving strategies
1. Planned resources relationship and diagrams entity relationship diagram.
2. Mapped authentication routes.

Integrate with a 3rd location-based API:

  - Autofill input field.
  - Drop pins on a map.
  - Add social features to site, such as chat boxes.
  - Allow users to make certain list items public, but default to private.
